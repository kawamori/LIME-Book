crid://crid_vod_02	Resident Evil	Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez star as Alice and Rain, two members of a commando team assigned to infiltrate the Hive, an underground research laboratory owned by the faceless conglomerate known as the Umbrella Corporation. A bio-engineered virus has been released into the maze-like Hive, turning the facility's employees into mindless, flesh-eating zombies. A single scratch or bite from one of these rampaging ghouls dooms its victim, so the commandos have their work cut out for them as they attempt to reach the Red Queen, the lab's supercomputer -- and their sole hope of halting the spread of the contagion. Before they can complete their mission, however, the soldiers must overcome a variety of deadly obstacles, including mutant dogs, lasers, and a genetically altered beast known as The Licker, whose strength increases with every victim it slays. Alice and Rain also discover that the release of the virus may not have been an accident, and that a cure may exist somewhere in the deadly Hive.	The film begins in The Hive, a top-secret genetic research facility owned by the Umbrella Corporation located deep beneath Raccoon City. A technician loads vials of blue and green liquid into a secured case, then tosses one blue vial onto the floor inside a lab, exits and seals the room. The vial breaks and the facility's security system, the Red Queen, detects possible infection, and in response, seals the Hive and kills everyone inside.	（C）2002 CONSTANTIN FILM PRODUKTION  GMBH/NEW LEGACY FILM LTD.	（C）2002 CONSTANTIN FILM PRODUKTION  GMBH/NEW LEGACY FILM LTD.	thumb/movie_00002_20090422_iptv_mid.jpg	thumb/movie_00002_20090422_iptv_big.jpg		
crid://crid_vod_03	The Pianist	Based on the autobiography of the same name by Jewish-Polish musician W?adys?aw Szpilman,the film won the Palme d'Or at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival, the Academy Awards for Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay.   	W?adys?aw Szpilman, a famous Polish Jewish pianist working for Warsaw Radio, sees his whole world collapse with the outbreak of World War II and the invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939. After the radio station is rocked by explosions from German bombing, Szpilman goes home and learns that Great Britain and France have declared war on Nazi Germany. He and his family rejoice, believing the war will end quickly. When the Nazis' armed SS organization occupies Warsaw after the regular army passes on, living conditions for the Jewish population gradually deteriorate as their rights are slowly eroded: first they are allowed only a limited amount of money per family, then they must wear armbands imprinted with the blue Star of David to identify themselves, and eventually, late in 1940, they are all forced into the squalid Warsaw Ghetto.
