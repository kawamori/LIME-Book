****************************************
</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.40" end="00:00:10.30">
Greetings, from here at ITU headquarters
 in Geneva, Switzerland
</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.30" end="00:00:15.30">
and welcome to this experiment
showcasing ITU's suite of IPTV standards.
</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.30" end="00:00:21.00">
This is the second year we have used
ITU-compliant IPTV equipment
</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.00" end="00:00:25.30">
to live-stream scenes
 from the Sapporo Snow Festival,
</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.30" end="00:00:29.30">
demonstrating in particular
ITU-T's "LIME" standard
</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.30" end="00:00:37.30">
- Recommendation ITU-T H.762
for interactive IPTV services.
</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.30" end="00:00:44.30">
This multi-country IPTV experiment
is possible thanks to the IPv6 test bed
</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.30" end="00:00:51.30">
provided by NICT, as well as the many other
companies participating in this experiment.
</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.30" end="00:00:56.30">
The IPTV market is showing considerable growth.
</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.30" end="00:01:04.30">
In 2012, IPTV subscriptions represented over
15% of worldwide broadband subscriptions,
</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.30" end="00:01:12.30">
equivalent to nearly 70 million subscribers,
or 9% of the world's 800 million
</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.30" end="00:01:14.30">
Pay-TV subscribers
</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.30" end="00:01:18.30">
The major growth is
in the Asia-Pacific region.
</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.30" end="00:01:25.30">
It is roughly two-thirds of the global
subscriber growth from 2012 to 2017.
</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.30" end="00:01:33.30">
This experiment demonstrates the maturity
of ITU's IPv6-ready IPTV standards.
</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.30" end="00:01:40.30">
ITU's international standards ensure that
anyone anywhere can develop products
</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.30" end="00:01:45.30">
and services to our standards
and enter a global market.
</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.30" end="00:01:51.30">
This increases competition, opens up
 opportunities for startup companies,
</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.30" end="00:01:54.80">
and reduces costs to consumers.
</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.80" end="00:02:00.50">
ITU's Standards also enable
communications technologies
</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.50" end="00:02:06.80">
produced by different companies and
countries to interoperate with one another,
</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.80" end="00:02:12.80">
and I encourage vendors to participate
in ITU's Interop events to determine
</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.80" end="00:02:16.80">
the interoperability of their products
from a global perspective.
</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.80" end="00:02:23.50">
You can find out more about ITU's IPTV
standardization work and our conformity

</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.80" end="00:02:34.80">
Thank you and I wish you
a very successful event.
</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.80" end="00:02:41.80">
